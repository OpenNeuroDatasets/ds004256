# Overview
The dataset consists of data from two experiments in which subjects were presented bursts of noise from loudspeakers at different elevations. Subjects who participated in either experiment were initially tested in their ability to localize elevated sound sources. Both experiments were conducted in a hemi-anechoic chamber.
